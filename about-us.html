                “We believe that children in the developing world need to live to strive, to learn and to challenge the obstacles that hinder their growth.  They deserve the opportunity to grow not only as individuals but as members of happy, prosperous communities. Education transforms lives; IHF knows that if these children are given access to proper schooling, their futures will be brighter, and so will the futures of the countries in which they live.”
